 # Sky-Above-Prototype

(Prototype ? O_o Yes, prototype it is. This is even the first version of Sky Above I dare to publish online, so very very young and imperfect program here).

Sky Above is my homebrew Moutain sized Vertical Platformer generator. It doesn't make a good acronym so let's call it Sky Above instead ;)

## The plot

The earth is transforming into venus, you must save yourself by ascending into the high atmosphere and making the tools you need to breathe and protect from the cold. At the end, you stabilize in the top of the himalayas. But how many person have you saved ? During the journey to the top, you will meet other people. You can bring them some furtnitures, create paths to help them to climb or even build an airship for those who can't walk... or let's be crazy, building an all airship federation and starting a new economy by traveling into the mines to take the crap of the old world and recreate a society into the clouds with a steampunk base. It's for you to see, as long as you get to the top, you have won.

## How it works ?

With a seed generator, Java, Swing, the dyn4j physics motor and a lot of textures and sweet colors.

## Can I play with it ?

- Playing ... playing for real, you mean ? I guess, it's a little playable for the moment. It still very buggy but it work basically.

- Programming ? Yeah, with pleasure. Feel free to explore the code and to make pull requests.

- Textures and sprites ? Yes, absolutely ! Send me a message and tell me what you want to do first.

 # Sky-Above-Prototype

(Prototype ? O_o Yes, prototype it is. This is even the first version of Sky Above I dare to publish online, so very very young and imperfect program here).

Sky Above is my homebrew Planet Sized Vertical Platformer generator. It doesn't make a good acronym so let's call it Sky Above instead ;)

## How it works ?

With a seed generator, Java, Swing, the dyn4j physics motor and a lot of textures and sweet colors.

## Can I play with it ?

- Playing ... playing for real, you mean ? I guess, it's a little playable for the moment. It still very buggy but it work basically.

- Programming ? No. I would love but for the moment, it is a secret project and a challenge I have put on myself to learn Java in deep :)  but hey, if you want, download it and fork it :)

- Textures and sprites ? Yes, absolutely ! Send me a message and tell me what you want to do first.

# Sky-Above-Prototype

(Prototype ? O_o Yes, prototype it is. This is even the first version of Sky Above I dare to publish online, so very very young and imperfect program here).

Sky Above is my homebrew Planet Size Vertical Platformer generator. It doesn't make a good acronym so let's call it Sky Above instead ;)

## How it works ?

With a seed generator, Java, Swing, the dyn4j physics motor and a lot of textures (somewhere in the development, I hope to make a texture generator).

## Can I play with it ?

- Playing ... playing for real, you mean ? It is not very playable for the moment. It still very buggy and you cannot use the core of the physics like it will be implemented
in the future. Stay tuned.

- Programming ? No. I would love but for the moment, it is a secret project and a challenge I have put on myself to learn Java in deep :) 
but hey, if you want, download it and fork it :)

PS : if you know a texture generator or would like to program one, forget the last paragraph and contact me :p

- Textures and sprites ? Yes, absolutely ! Send me a message and tell me what you want to do first.
